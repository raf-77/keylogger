# keylogger
Basic keylogger to understand functionality

Its not possible to run this script as an .exe on windows systems undetected and is only meant to get comprehention of how keyloggers work. Only run this on your own system or systems you got the permission to run the script and replace the "xxx.xxx.x.xxx" with your servers ip you want to receive the log on. 
Make sure both client and host have python installed.
Possible additions:
- encrypt the data before sending it to the server
- open port via UPnP
- privilege escalation, make it run as an administrator
- add to windows registry to autorun the script on startup/hide console
- remove comments and change function names
- obfuscate the .exe
